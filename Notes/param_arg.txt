Parameters and arguments are terms used in programming to distinguish 
between two related concepts when defining and calling functions or methods.

1. Parameters:
- Parameters are variables or placeholders defined in a function or method declaration. 
They act as input slots that allow you to pass values into the function when it's called.
- Parameters define the data type and the name of the values that the function expects to receive.
- They serve as a kind of contract between the function definition and its callers, specifying what 
  kind of data the function should operate on.

2. Arguments:
- Arguments are the actual values or expressions that are passed to a function or method when it is called.
- Arguments are the concrete data that you supply to the function based on the parameters it expects.
- When a function is called, the arguments provided must match the parameters in terms of data type and order.
Here's an example in C++ to illustrate the difference between parameters and arguments:
```cpp

#include <iostream>
// This is a function declaration with two parameters
void printSum(int num1, int num2);
int main() {
int a = 5;
int b = 7;
// Here, a and b are arguments passed to the function printSum
printSum(a, b);
return 0;
}
// This is the function definition that uses the parameters
void printSum(int num1, int num2) {
int sum = num1 + num2;
std::cout << "Sum is: " << sum << std::endl;
}
```
In this example, `printSum` is a function with two parameters `num1` and `num2`. 
When calling this function in `main`, `a` and `b` are the arguments passed to it. 
The function uses these arguments (values of `a` and `b`) to perform a calculation and print the result. 
Parameters are like placeholders that receive the actual values provided as arguments when the function is called.
